# drzzl - the weather of and celebration for rainy days

Introducing the weather app that rejoices in the pleasant pitter-patter of a softly falling rain. You are instantly greeted by hyper-local weather reporting, but stay a while and enjoy inspirational photography and art by users around the world. Be sure to have a cup of tea or coffee, your favorite book, or a blanket nearby because it soon might drzzl.



## Getting Started & Features

drzzl works with your web browser to pull your local forecast.
