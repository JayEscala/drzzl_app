# drzzl - the weather of and celebration for rainy days

Introducing the weather app that rejoices in the pleasant pitter-patter of a softly falling rain. You are instantly greeted by hyper-local weather reporting, but stay a while and enjoy inspirational photography and art by users around the world. Be sure to have a cup of tea or coffee, your favorite book, or a blanket nearby because it soon might drzzl.



## Getting Started & Features

Simply visit our drzzl.io website and enjoy! There is no subscription, no app to install, no data mining, and no trouble!

drzzl works with your web browser to pull your local forecast.
